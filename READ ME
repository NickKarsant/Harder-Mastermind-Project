Colors are Red, Blue, Grren or Yellow. or R, G, B, Y.

Mastermind is a game where you try to guess the sequence of letters that represent colored pegs.  
After each guess you are told the number of exact matches, meaning the correct color in the correct spot, or 
near matches, meaning the correct color is in the sequence but not in the right location.  

In the previous iteration of this game if the secret code was "BYRG" and oe of the guesses was "BYYG", 
it would return 3 exact matches and 1 near match.  The near match happens because the Y in BYRG would count as 
a near match for the second Y of BYYG. In my opinion, this is a less accurate and easier form of the game.

My iteration of MasterMind behaves slightly differently.  If BYRG is the secret code and BYYG is the guess, 
it will return 3 exact matches and 0 near matches.  The reason for this is that since the B, Y, and R of BYRG have been identified as
exact matches and can no longer be refered to as a near match. There is no other Y in the secret code for the Y in our guess to be 
a near match to since the Y in the secret code was identified as an exact match already.  Good Luck.
